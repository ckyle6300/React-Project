## Welcome to Crypto-Robinhood
***[Crypto-Robinhood](https://crypto-robinhood.herokuapp.com/)*** is a site that is made for users to simulate buying and selling of cryptocurrencies. The website is based off of [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/) and [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/). The site uses an external api to get up to date crypto prices and information. 

#### Technologies: React, Redux, Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, CSS3

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The main goal of this full-stack project was to follow through with my mvp features, which include:

- Dashboard + Portfolio - Users can see the value of their portfolio. Users can buy and sell cryptos.
- Crypto Details - Users get a background on the crypto.
- Watchlist - Users can add a crypto to a watch list.
- Crypto Search - Users can search cryptos by name or symbol. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Splash Page
The splash page is modeled based off of Coin Market Cap website. I decided that the splash page was intuitive enough not to be a more traditional splash page. I wanted users who do not have an account to have the ability to still check the prices and infomation about the cryptocurrencies they are interested in. In the navbar, it gives users the ability to so login, signup, or search for cryptocurrencies in the a search module. Once a user signs up, they get more functionality. Users are given fake 10k to buy and sell crypto. They also gain the functionality of being able to add and remove crypto from a watchlist. Users can also click on the profile button to get an overview of their portfolio. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Profile Page
On this page, signed in users get an overview of their portfolio. They can see how much crypto they own. They can also sell crypto on this page. Lower down the page, current announcements on projects are announced. The announcements usually have links, so users can get more information on the announcement.

## Crypto Info Page
On this page, users can get an overview of a cryptocurrency. There is a chart that shows the price history and volume history over the past month. At the bottom portion of the screen, it gives the user a background on the cryptocurrency. On the right side of the screen, it gives a user financial information of the coin. If the user is logged in, they will gain access to buttons that will allow them to add the crypto to a watchlist. They will have the ability to buy the cryptocurrency. The prices are updated live every 40 seconds.
